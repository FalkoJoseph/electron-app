TypeScript Best Practices
- Write concise, readable, and type-safe code.
- Avoid any; prefer explicit types and interfaces over types/enums.
- Follow PascalCase (classes), camelCase (variables/methods), and kebab-case (files).
- Use descriptive names with verbs for functions and booleans (isLoading, hasError).
- Keep functions short, single-purpose, and avoid deep nesting.
- Prefer immutability (readonly, as const) and structured data over primitives.
- Handle exceptions properlyâ€”catch only when adding context or fixing expected issues.
- Use complete words instead of abbreviations and correct spelling.
  - Except for standard abbreviations like API, URL, etc.
  - Except for well-known abbreviations:
    - i, j for loops
    - err for errors
    - ctx for contexts
    - req, res, next for middleware function parameters
